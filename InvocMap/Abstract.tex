	Implementing correct  method invocation is an important task for software developers. However, this is a challenging work, since the structure of method invocation can be complicated. In this work, we propose InvocMap, a code completion tool that allows developers to get the correct implementation structure of multiple method invocations from a list of method names inside code context. InvocMap can predict the nested method invocations which their names didn't appear in the list of input method names given by developers. To achieve this, we analyze the Method Invocations by four levels of abstraction. We build a Machine Translation engine to learn the mapping from first level to the third level of abstraction of multiple method invocations, which only requires developers to manually add local variables from generated expression to get the final code. We evaluate our proposed approach on six popular libraries: JDK, Android, GWT, Joda-Time, Hibernate, and Xstream. With the training corpus of 2.86 million method invocations extracted from 1000 Java Github projects and the testing corpus extracted from 120 online forums code snippets, InvocMap  achieves accuracy up to 84 in F1-score depending on how much information of context provided along with method names, which shows its potential for auto code completion.
